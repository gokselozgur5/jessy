//! Test-driven development for comprehensive error handling
//!
//! These tests define the expected behavior for error scenarios
//! before implementing the actual error handling logic.
//!
//! # Testing Philosophy
//!
//! Write tests first (TDD) - they document expected behavior
//! Test error paths, not just happy paths - errors are part of the API
//! Use descriptive test names - they're documentation
