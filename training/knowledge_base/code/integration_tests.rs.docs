//! Integration tests for memory manager
//!
//! Task 9.3: Comprehensive integration tests that verify:
//! - Full system load (all 14 dimensions)
//! - Proto-dimension workflow (create→access→crystallize)
//! - Error recovery scenarios
//! - Memory usage within 280MB budget
//!
//! These tests validate the complete memory manager system working together,
//! not just individual components.
