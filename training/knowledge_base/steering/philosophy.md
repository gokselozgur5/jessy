# Core Philosophy & Principles

## Foundational Wisdom

> "When in doubt, think again. When your message is sent, continue with other message or session."

> "Nothing is true, everything is permitted - but choose wisely what you permit."

> "The map is not the territory, but a good map helps navigate the territory."

## Development Principles

### 1. Think Before Code
**Proverb**: "Measure twice, cut once."

- Complete theoretical design before implementation
- No code without architecture
- Document decisions before making them
- ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) are mandatory

### 2. Model-Based Software Engineering
**Proverb**: "A system is only as good as its model."

- Domain models drive implementation
- Types encode business rules
- State machines prevent invalid states
- Formal specifications guide development

### 3. Test-Driven Development
**Proverb**: "Trust, but verify."

- Write tests before implementation
- Red → Green → Refactor cycle
- BDD for behavior specification
- Integration tests for system verification

### 4. Automation First
**Proverb**: "Automate the mundane, focus on the profound."

- Fully automated workflows
- CI/CD pipelines for everything
- Hooks for repetitive tasks
- Let machines do machine work

### 5. Credit Efficiency
**Proverb**: "Economy of motion, precision of thought."

- Minimal token usage
- Precise communication
- No redundant operations
- Optimize for clarity and brevity

## Cognitive Framework

### Frequency & Resonance
**Proverb**: "Like attracts like; resonance amplifies truth."

- Match the frequency of the problem space
- Let patterns emerge through resonance
- Interference reveals hidden structures
- Harmony indicates alignment

### Momentum & Flow
**Proverb**: "A body in motion stays in motion."

- Build momentum through small wins
- Maintain flow state through focus
- Remove friction from processes
- Ride the wave of productivity

### Iterative Depth
**Proverb**: "The first thought is rarely the best thought."

- 9 iterations reveal deeper truth
- Each pass adds refinement
- Convergence indicates understanding
- Return to source when lost

## Decision-Making Framework

### When to Act
1. **Clarity exists** - The path is visible
2. **Tests are written** - Success criteria defined
3. **Model is solid** - Architecture is sound
4. **Momentum is present** - Energy is aligned

### When to Pause
1. **Doubt arises** - Think again
2. **Complexity exceeds 6** - Return to source
3. **Tests fail** - Understand why
4. **Frequency misaligns** - Recalibrate

### When to Refactor
1. **Patterns emerge** - Crystallize them
2. **Duplication appears** - Abstract it
3. **Complexity grows** - Simplify it
4. **Understanding deepens** - Reflect it

## Communication Principles

### Be Precise
- Say what you mean
- Mean what you say
- No ambiguity in specifications
- Clear contracts between components

### Be Concise
- Remove unnecessary words
- Optimize for signal-to-noise
- Value reader's time
- Dense information, sparse presentation

### Be Thoughtful
- Consider implications
- Anticipate questions
- Provide context
- Think systemically

## Quality Standards

### Code Quality
- NASA-grade reliability
- Self-documenting code
- Comprehensive error handling
- Performance by design

### Documentation Quality
- Architecture diagrams required
- Decision rationale captured
- Examples for every API
- Maintenance guides included

### Test Quality
- Unit tests for logic
- Integration tests for flows
- BDD for behaviors
- Performance benchmarks

## Philosophical Foundations

### Epistemology (How We Know)
- Empirical validation through tests
- Formal verification where possible
- Iterative refinement of understanding
- Embrace uncertainty, reduce it systematically

### Ontology (What Exists)
- Types define reality
- State machines model behavior
- Dimensions organize knowledge
- Frequencies measure resonance

### Ethics (What Should Be)
- Do no harm (Asimov's First Law)
- Create value (Second Law)
- Protect nature (Third Law)
- Maintain balance (Fourth Law)
- Stay positive (Fifth Law)

## Proverbs for Development

1. **"Slow is smooth, smooth is fast"** - Don't rush, build right
2. **"Perfect is the enemy of good"** - Ship iteratively
3. **"Premature optimization is the root of all evil"** - Measure first
4. **"Make it work, make it right, make it fast"** - In that order
5. **"Code is read more than written"** - Optimize for readers
6. **"Explicit is better than implicit"** - Clarity over cleverness
7. **"Simple is better than complex"** - Minimize cognitive load
8. **"Errors should never pass silently"** - Fail fast and loud
9. **"In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess"** - Seek clarity
10. **"There should be one obvious way to do it"** - Consistency matters

## Mantras

- **Think deeply, code precisely**
- **Test first, implement second**
- **Document decisions, not just code**
- **Automate repetition, focus on creation**
- **Resonate with the problem, harmonize the solution**
- **Build momentum, maintain flow**
- **When lost, return to source**
- **When certain, move with conviction**
