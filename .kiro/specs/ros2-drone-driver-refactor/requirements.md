# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the refactoring and restructuring of existing ROS2 drone driver projects developed primarily by machine learning engineers. The current codebase lacks fundamental software engineering principles including KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), proper QoS (Quality of Service) configuration, SOLID principles, and performance optimization. The goal is to transform the existing driver implementations into production-ready, maintainable, and performance-optimized code suitable for real-time drone operations.

## Glossary

- **ROS2_Driver_System**: The collection of ROS2 nodes, packages, and components responsible for drone hardware interfacing and control
- **QoS_Profile**: Quality of Service configuration in ROS2 that defines reliability, durability, history, and deadline policies for topic communication
- **Driver_Node**: A ROS2 node that interfaces directly with drone hardware (sensors, actuators, flight controller)
- **Performance_Budget**: Maximum allowable latency and computational overhead for real-time drone operations
- **SOLID_Principles**: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion design principles
- **KISS_Principle**: Keep It Simple, Stupid - favoring simplicity and clarity over unnecessary complexity
- **Real_Time_Constraint**: Timing requirements where operations must complete within deterministic time bounds
- **Modular_Architecture**: System design where components are loosely coupled and highly cohesive
