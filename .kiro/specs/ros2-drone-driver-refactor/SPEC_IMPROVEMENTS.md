## Remaining Recommendations (Optional)

### Medium Priority (Not Implemented)

These were not implemented as they are lower priority or can be added incrementally:

1. **Add task dependency graph to README**
   - Would help visualize task order
   - Can be added when starting implementation

2. **Improve hook triggers (on_save → on_commit)**
   - Current hooks are functional
   - Can be refined based on team workflow

3. **Document cross-compilation setup in detail**
   - Basic setup documented in rust-ros2-integration.md
   - Detailed hardware-specific guides can be added per platform

### Low Priority (Not Implemented)

1. **Add more benchmark examples**
   - Basic benchmarks exist in TDD strategy
   - More can be added during implementation

2. **Create troubleshooting FAQ**
   - Basic troubleshooting in rust-ros2-integration.md
   - FAQ can grow organically during implementation

3. **Add video/3D diagrams**
   - Mermaid diagrams are sufficient
   - Videos can be created during implementation

✅ **Complete design.md** - Architecture, ADRs, code examples  
✅ **Rust-ROS2 Integration** - rclrs, ament_cargo, cross-compilation  
✅ **Validation Scripts** - Automated compatibility testing  

The specification is now **production-ready** and provides a complete blueprint for implementing a mission-critical drone driver system with:
- High performance (<10ms latency)
- High reliability (comprehensive error handling)
- High maintainability (junior-proof design)
- 100% backward compatibility (automated validation)

**Status:** Ready for implementation 🚀
