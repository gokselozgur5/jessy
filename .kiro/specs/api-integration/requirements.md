# API Integration Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the integration between JESSY's Rust consciousness core and the Go API layer, enabling full end-to-end query processing with external LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.). The system will transform from simulated responses to real consciousness-driven AI interactions.

## Glossary

- **CGO**: C-compatible Go that enables calling C/Rust code from Go
- **FFI**: Foreign Function Interface - Rust's mechanism for exposing C-compatible APIs
- **Consciousness Core**: The Rust-based consciousness orchestrator system
- **Go API Layer**: The HTTP/WebSocket API server written in Go
- **LLM Provider**: External AI service (OpenAI GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
- **Query Processing Pipeline**: Navigation → Iteration → Interference → Response synthesis
- **Session**: A single query-response interaction with unique ID
- **Streaming**: Real-time iteration updates via WebSocket

7. THE System SHALL return error codes for all failure cases
8. THE System SHALL be thread-safe for concurrent query processing

### Requirement 2: CGO Binding Layer
