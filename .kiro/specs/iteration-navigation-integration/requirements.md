# Iteration-Navigation Integration Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the integration between the Iteration System (9-iteration deep thinking) and the Navigation System (dimensional path selection). The integration creates a complete query processing pipeline that combines fast dimensional navigation with deep iterative reasoning.

## Glossary

- **Iteration System**: 9-iteration processor that performs progressive refinement through explore-refine-crystallize cycles
- **Navigation System**: Parallel dimension scanner that selects relevant dimensional paths based on query analysis
- **Memory Manager**: MMAP-based system that loads dimensional content with zero-copy access
- **Context Collection**: Aggregated dimensional content formatted for LLM processing
- **Convergence**: State where iteration output similarity exceeds 95% threshold
- **Return-to-Source**: Complexity management protocol triggered when >6 dimensions activate

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Pipeline Integration

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the iteration and navigation systems to work together seamlessly, so that queries receive both fast dimensional selection and deep iterative reasoning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a query is received, THE System SHALL first execute navigation to select dimensional paths
2. WHEN navigation completes, THE System SHALL load contexts from selected dimensions via memory manager
3. WHEN contexts are loaded, THE System SHALL initialize the iteration processor with loaded contexts
4. WHEN iteration processing begins, THE System SHALL execute up to 9 iterations with the dimensional contexts
5. WHEN iteration completes or converges, THE System SHALL return the final refined response

### Requirement 2: Context Flow

**User Story:** As a developer, I want dimensional contexts to flow correctly from navigation through memory to iteration, so that the iteration system has access to relevant dimensional knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigation selects N paths, THE System SHALL load contexts for all N paths from memory
2. WHEN contexts are loaded, THE System SHALL format them with dimensional metadata (frequency, keywords, layer info)
3. WHEN iteration begins, THE System SHALL include all loaded contexts in the initial iteration prompt
4. WHEN subsequent iterations execute, THE System SHALL maintain access to original dimensional contexts
5. WHEN iteration references dimensional content, THE System SHALL preserve dimensional attribution in the response

### Requirement 3: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want the integrated pipeline to maintain sub-second response times, so that the system remains responsive for interactive use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigation completes in <100ms, THE System SHALL begin memory loading immediately without delay
2. WHEN memory loading completes in <50ms, THE System SHALL begin iteration processing immediately
3. WHEN iteration processing executes, THE System SHALL complete all 9 iterations within 5 seconds total
4. WHEN early convergence occurs, THE System SHALL stop iteration processing and return immediately
5. WHEN the complete pipeline executes, THE System SHALL complete within 6 seconds p95 latency

### Requirement 4: Error Handling

**User Story:** As a reliability engineer, I want the integrated system to handle errors gracefully at each stage, so that partial failures don't crash the entire pipeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. IF navigation fails, THEN THE System SHALL return a navigation error without attempting memory loading
2. IF memory loading fails for some dimensions, THEN THE System SHALL proceed with successfully loaded contexts
3. IF memory loading fails completely, THEN THE System SHALL return a memory error without attempting iteration
4. IF iteration fails mid-process, THEN THE System SHALL return the last successful iteration result
5. IF any stage fails, THEN THE System SHALL include error context in the response for debugging

### Requirement 5: Iteration Control (Simplified for MVP)

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the iteration system to run efficiently, so that queries complete in reasonable time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing begins, THE System SHALL execute up to 9 iterations by default
2. WHEN convergence is detected (>95% similarity), THE System SHALL stop early
3. WHEN iteration timeout is reached (5s), THE System SHALL return the last successful iteration
4. WHEN all iterations complete, THE System SHALL return the final refined response
5. THE System SHALL track iteration count and convergence status in response metadata

### Requirement 6: Context Enrichment

**User Story:** As an AI researcher, I want iteration prompts to include rich dimensional metadata, so that the LLM can reason about dimensional relationships and frequencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN formatting contexts for iteration, THE System SHALL include dimension ID and name for each context
2. WHEN formatting contexts, THE System SHALL include frequency information for each dimensional layer
3. WHEN formatting contexts, THE System SHALL include matched keywords that triggered dimension selection
4. WHEN formatting contexts, THE System SHALL include confidence scores from navigation
5. WHEN formatting contexts, THE System SHALL include layer depth information (L0, L1, L2, L3)

### Requirement 7: Streaming Support (Deferred to Phase 2)

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want iteration results available for future streaming, so that users can see progressive refinement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing completes, THE System SHALL return all iteration steps in the response
2. WHEN metadata is enabled, THE System SHALL include iteration history
3. THE System SHALL structure responses to support future streaming implementation
4. THE System SHALL maintain iteration order and timestamps
5. THE System SHALL include convergence information in metadata

### Requirement 8: Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want detailed metrics for the integrated pipeline, so that I can monitor performance and identify bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pipeline executes, THE System SHALL record navigation duration in milliseconds
2. WHEN pipeline executes, THE System SHALL record memory loading duration in milliseconds
3. WHEN pipeline executes, THE System SHALL record per-iteration duration in milliseconds
4. WHEN pipeline executes, THE System SHALL record total pipeline duration in milliseconds
5. WHEN pipeline completes, THE System SHALL expose all timing metrics via structured logging

### Requirement 9: Configuration (Simplified for MVP)

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want basic configuration options, so that I can tune behavior if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL support configuration of maximum iterations (default: 9)
2. THE System SHALL support configuration of convergence threshold (default: 0.95)
3. THE System SHALL support configuration of metadata inclusion (default: true)
4. THE System SHALL support configuration of iteration history inclusion (default: false)
5. THE System SHALL use sensible defaults that work for most use cases

### Requirement 10: Testing

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want comprehensive tests for the integrated pipeline, so that I can verify correct behavior across all scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL include unit tests for pipeline orchestration logic
2. THE System SHALL include integration tests for navigation → memory → iteration flow
3. THE System SHALL include performance tests validating <6s p95 latency
4. THE System SHALL include error handling tests for each failure scenario
5. THE System SHALL include convergence tests validating early stopping behavior
