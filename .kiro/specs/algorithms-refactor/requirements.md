# Requirements Document - GPS Odometry Algorithm Refactor

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for refactoring the GPS Odometry algorithm package from Python to Rust. The GPS Odometry system transforms GPS velocity data from the global ENU (East-North-Up) frame to the robot's body frame (baselink) using IMU orientation data. This refactor aims to improve performance, numerical stability, and deterministic behavior while maintaining 100% backward compatibility with the existing Python implementation.

## Glossary

- **GPS_Odometry_System**: The Rust-based ROS2 node that processes GPS velocity and IMU data to produce body-frame odometry
- **ENU_Frame**: East-North-Up coordinate frame (global/map frame)
- **Body_Frame**: Robot's local coordinate frame (baselink/FLU - Forward-Left-Up)
- **Quaternion**: Four-dimensional complex number used for 3D rotations
- **Odometry**: Robot pose and velocity estimation
- **Covariance**: Statistical measure of uncertainty in measurements
- **Gaussian_Noise**: Random noise following normal distribution
- **Numerical_Stability**: Ability to handle edge cases (NaN, zero quaternions) without crashes
