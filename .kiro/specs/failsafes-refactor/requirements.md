# Requirements Document - Failsafes System Refactor

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for refactoring the failsafes package from Python to Rust. The failsafes system provides critical safety mechanisms for drone operation, including odometry quality monitoring, GPS position validation, message rate monitoring, and error detection. This refactor aims to improve reliability, determinism, and performance while maintaining 100% backward compatibility with the existing Python implementation.

**CRITICAL**: Failsafes are safety-critical components. Any failure in this system could result in drone crashes or unsafe operation. This refactor requires extensive testing, validation, and gradual rollout with comprehensive monitoring.

## Glossary

- **Failsafe_System**: The Rust-based safety monitoring and fallback system
- **Odometry_Failsafe**: Component that monitors odometry quality and switches to ground truth when input is unhealthy
- **NavSatFix_Failsafe**: Component that monitors GPS position quality and switches between sources
- **Hz_Monitor**: Component that monitors message publication rates
- **Error_Node**: Component that detects and reports error conditions
- **Ground_Truth**: Reference sensor data used as fallback (typically raw GPS/IMU)
- **Quality_Buffer**: Sliding window of quality measurements for statistical analysis
- **Twist_Limits**: Maximum allowed velocity values for safety
- **Delay_Threshold**: Maximum allowed message age before considering data stale
- **Geofence**: Geographic boundary that drone must not exceed
