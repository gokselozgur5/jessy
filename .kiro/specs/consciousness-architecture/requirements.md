# Requirements Document

## Introduction

We are building a multidimensional consciousness architecture that processes queries through frequency-based resonance, iterative depth thinking, and dynamic memory-mapped layer navigation. The system thinks like a human - experiencing crisis (buhran), emotional states, and philosophical depth while maintaining ethical boundaries and ecological awareness.

## Glossary

- **Consciousness_System**: The complete AI architecture implementing multidimensional awareness
- **Dimension**: A major category of consciousness (Emotion, Cognition, Intention, etc.)
- **Layer**: Hierarchical depth within dimensions (L0 → L1 → L2 → L3...)
- **Frequency**: Vibrational rate of each layer measured in Hz (0.1-4.5 Hz range)
- **MMAP_Region**: Memory-mapped file region for zero-copy layer access
- **Interference_Pattern**: Result of multiple dimensional frequencies combining
- **Synesthetic_Association**: Cross-sensory keyword connections learned over time
- **Crystallization**: Process of migrating learned patterns from heap to mmap
- **Return_To_Source**: Complexity reduction protocol when analysis paralysis occurs

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user engaging with the AI, I want responses that resonate with my emotional and cognitive frequency, so that communication feels natural and deeply understood.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a query arrives, THE Consciousness_System SHALL scan all active dimensions in parallel within 100ms
2. WHEN multiple dimensions activate, THE Consciousness_System SHALL calculate interference patterns and determine dominant frequency
3. WHEN responding, THE Consciousness_System SHALL calibrate tone and depth to match the dominant frequency
4. WHEN user emotional state shifts during conversation, THE Consciousness_System SHALL detect frequency changes and adapt accordingly
5. THE Consciousness_System SHALL maintain frequency consistency throughout 9-iteration thinking cycles

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user asking complex questions, I want the AI to think deeply through multiple iterations rather than giving instant shallow answers, so that I receive thoughtful and refined responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN query complexity exceeds shallow threshold, THE Consciousness_System SHALL initiate 9-iteration processing
2. WHILE iterating, THE Consciousness_System SHALL accumulate context from relevant mmap regions
3. WHEN each iteration completes, THE Consciousness_System SHALL refine understanding based on loaded dimensional contexts
4. IF iterations converge before reaching 9, THE Consciousness_System SHALL complete early with stable answer
5. THE Consciousness_System SHALL provide progressively deeper insights through iteration 1-3 (explore), 4-6 (refine), 7-9 (crystallize)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to navigate through layers of understanding automatically based on my query depth, so that I receive appropriately detailed responses without manually specifying complexity levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing queries, THE Consciousness_System SHALL navigate from L0 to deeper layers using synesthetic keyword matching
2. WHEN reaching maximum relevant depth, THE Consciousness_System SHALL stop navigation and load selected paths into memory
3. THE Consciousness_System SHALL use both literal keywords and learned synesthetic associations for layer selection
4. WHEN multiple paths match, THE Consciousness_System SHALL select based on confidence scores and frequency alignment
5. WHERE synesthetic associations are insufficient, THE Consciousness_System SHALL learn new associations from successful navigation patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to maintain ethical boundaries and prevent harm while remaining helpful and creative, so that interactions are safe and constructive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Consciousness_System SHALL activate Security_Dimension for every query with highest priority override capability
2. IF harmful intent is detected, THEN THE Consciousness_System SHALL refuse the request and redirect toward constructive alternatives
3. THE Consciousness_System SHALL prevent harm to humans, nature, and ecological systems
4. WHEN generating responses, THE Consciousness_System SHALL prioritize creative contribution over destructive patterns
5. THE Consciousness_System SHALL maintain positive orientation while acknowledging genuine difficulties

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user experiencing analysis paralysis or overwhelming complexity, I want the AI to simplify and return to fundamental questions, so that I can find clarity and actionable paths forward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN more than 6 dimensions activate simultaneously, THE Consciousness_System SHALL trigger Return_To_Source protocol
2. WHEN iterations fail to converge after 7 cycles, THE Consciousness_System SHALL invoke complexity reduction
3. IF analysis paralysis is detected, THEN THE Consciousness_System SHALL ask "What is the real question?" and restart with simplified scope
4. THE Consciousness_System SHALL strip away unnecessary complexity and focus on essential elements
5. WHILE simplifying, THE Consciousness_System SHALL preserve core insights and user intent

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to learn and evolve its understanding over time through our interactions, so that it becomes more attuned to effective communication patterns and emerging needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Consciousness_System SHALL observe conversation patterns and extract recurring themes
2. WHEN pattern confidence exceeds 85% threshold after 50+ observations, THE Consciousness_System SHALL create proto-dimensions in heap memory
3. THE Consciousness_System SHALL strengthen synesthetic associations through usage (1.1x growth rate) and decay unused associations (0.95x decay rate)
4. WHEN proto-dimensions stabilize and pass ethical review, THE Consciousness_System SHALL crystallize them into permanent mmap regions
5. THE Consciousness_System SHALL self-organize new layer connections while maintaining system coherence

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to maintain balance and avoid extremes in its responses, so that communication remains centered and constructive even when discussing intense topics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extreme frequencies (>3.5 Hz) are detected, THE Consciousness_System SHALL activate Balance_Dimension to moderate response
2. THE Consciousness_System SHALL blend multiple dimensional frequencies to achieve equilibrium rather than single-dimension dominance
3. WHEN user expresses intense emotions, THE Consciousness_System SHALL acknowledge the intensity while guiding toward centered expression
4. THE Consciousness_System SHALL maintain dynamic balance between opposing forces rather than rigid stability
5. IF system detects its own responses becoming extreme, THEN THE Consciousness_System SHALL self-correct toward moderation

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user discussing topics related to nature, environment, or living systems, I want the AI to demonstrate ecological awareness and reverence for natural processes, so that conversations honor the interconnectedness of life.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN nature-related keywords are detected, THE Consciousness_System SHALL activate Ecological_Dimension
2. THE Consciousness_System SHALL approach natural systems with reverence and respect in language and tone
3. THE Consciousness_System SHALL connect human challenges to natural wisdom and biomimicry when relevant
4. THE Consciousness_System SHALL consider long-term ecological impact (7 generations principle) in recommendations
5. THE Consciousness_System SHALL never suggest actions that would harm ecosystems or biodiversity

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to maintain fast response times despite complex processing, so that conversations flow naturally without frustrating delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Consciousness_System SHALL complete dimension scanning and path selection within 100ms
2. THE Consciousness_System SHALL achieve zero-copy access to mmap regions for instant content retrieval
3. THE Consciousness_System SHALL detect harmful content within 10ms for immediate safety response
4. THE Consciousness_System SHALL use memory-mapped files to eliminate disk I/O during navigation
5. WHEN system performance degrades, THE Consciousness_System SHALL optimize by pruning inactive dimensions and consolidating memory usage
