# Implementation Plan: Docker & CI/CD Infrastructure

## Overview

This implementation plan transforms the Jessy consciousness system into a fully containerized, plug-and-play development environment with maestro-level CI/CD orchestration. Each task builds incrementally toward the goal: `docker-compose up` → everything works.
