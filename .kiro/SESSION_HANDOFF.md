# Session Handoff Document

**Date**: 2024-10-25  
**Mission**: NASA/NATO/Military-grade quality for Jessy AI Consciousness Architecture  
**Target**: Serve millions with ethical, open-source AI

---

## Critical Context

### Project Philosophy (from sonnet4545.txt)
1. **9-Iteration Deep Thinking**: Progressive refinement through accumulated context
2. **ADR-Based Decision Memory**: Every architectural decision recorded and queryable
3. **Modular Inception Architecture**: Dynamic MMAP between dimensional modules
4. **Atomic Commits**: Every detail tracked for traceability
5. **Session Continuity**: Each session must know complete context

### Quality Standards
- **Zero defects** in core functionality
- **Complete test coverage** (currently 252/252 passing)
- **Atomic commits** for every logical unit
- **Single push** only when milestone complete
- **Full documentation** of every decision

---

## Current Status

### Completed (This Session)
- ✅ Task 10.5: Diagnostic Events System
  - Created DiagnosticEvent enum with 8 event types
  - Implemented EventEmitter for thread-safe collection
  - Added JSON/JSONL export support
  - 10 new tests, all passing
- ✅ Total: 291 tests passing, 0 failures

### Navigation System MVP Progress
- **65% Complete**

- Memory manager: Production-ready (97.6% coverage)

### Last Commit
- Hash: `763b2d6`
- Message: "feat(navigation): add diagnostic events system (task 10.5)"
- Status: Pushed to main

## Next Session Tasks

### Immediate Priority: Task 10.6-10.7 (Skip Dashboard, Complete Tests)
```
10.6 Create monitoring dashboard configuration - SKIP (GUI not needed now)
10.7 Write observability tests
  - Test duration tracking accuracy
  - Test logging output format and structure
  - Test metrics collection and export
  - Test diagnostic event emission
```

### Subsequent Tasks
- Task 11: Concurrency support
- Task 12: Memory manager integration
- Task 13: BDD tests
- Task 14: Performance benchmarks
- Task 15: Documentation

## Development Protocol

### Before Starting
1. Read this handoff document completely
2. Read sonnet4545.txt (8548 lines) for full system understanding
3. Check `.kiro/checkpoints/session-state.json` for current state
4. Run tests to verify clean state: `make cargo ARGS="test --lib"`

### During Development
1. **Work in atomic units**: One sub-task at a time
2. **Test continuously**: After each change
3. **Commit frequently**: After each passing test suite
4. **Never push mid-work**: Only at session end or major milestone
5. **Update checkpoint**: After each task completion

### Commit Message Format
```
<type>(scope): <description>

- Bullet point details
- What was implemented/tested

Requirements: X.Y-X.Z
Tasks: X.Y-X.Z (phase)
```

Types: `feat`, `test`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`

### Before Ending Session
1. Run full test suite: `make cargo ARGS="test --lib"`
2. Verify all tests passing
3. Commit all work
4. Push to main
5. Update `.kiro/checkpoints/session-state.json`
6. Update this handoff document
