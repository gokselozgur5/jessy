# Jessy Development Session Notes

**Purpose:** Track progress, preserve context, maintain momentum

---

## Session 2024-10-24 (Initial Setup)

### Completed ✅
- Created comprehensive Docker & CI/CD infrastructure spec
  - Requirements (10 user stories, 50 acceptance criteria)
  - Design (multi-stage Dockerfiles, docker-compose, GitHub Actions)
  - Tasks (40+ implementation tasks)
- Organized documentation structure
  - Created `docs/specifications/` with NASA-standard specs
  - Memory Manager spec (requirements + design)
  - Navigation System spec (complete)
  - Learning System spec (complete)
  - Docker & CI/CD spec (complete)
- Created Development Principles document
  - 6 MUST principles (KISS, YAGNI, Modular, Aerospace, Living System, English)
  - Living System design patterns
  - Stress detection and response
  - Kiro-specific workflow (atomic commits, periodic pushes)
- Updated main README with documentation links

### In Progress 🚧
- Phase 0: Compilation fix
  * Created stub files for all missing modules ✅
  * Simplified Dockerfile.rust ✅
  * Docker build in progress (waiting for completion)
  * Next: Verify cargo check passes

### Blockers 🚫
- None

### Next Session 🎯
**Priority:** Start Docker infrastructure implementation

**Recommended Tasks:**
1. Task 1.1: Create multi-stage Dockerfile for Rust service
2. Task 1.2: Create multi-stage Dockerfile for Go API
3. Task 1.3: Create test runner Dockerfile
4. Task 1.4: Write docker-compose.yml configuration

**Alternative:** Fix compilation errors first (Phase 0)
- Fix syntax error in patterns.rs
- Create stub files for missing modules
- Verify `cargo build` succeeds

### Notes 📝
- All specs follow EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax)
- All requirements comply with INCOSE quality rules
- Development follows TDD: Write tests first, implement second
- Commit atomically, push frequently
- Document as you go

### Context for AI 🤖
- Project: Jessy consciousness system
- Language: Rust (core) + Go (API)
- Development: Docker-first, TDD, NASA-grade quality
- Current state: Specs complete, implementation pending
- Philosophy: "Living system where cognitive stress corrupts hardware"
