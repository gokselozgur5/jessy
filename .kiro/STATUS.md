## ðŸŒ¿ Special Notes

**No Questions Asked**:
Per sonnet4545.txt final instruction - this system proceeds with best judgment, states assumptions, and acts. User will correct if wrong.

**D17-Agency (from sonnet4545.txt)**:
```
D17: Agency & Initiative (emergent)
  - DecisionMaking.AutonomousChoice.ReasonedAction
  - Confidence.TrustOwnJudgment
  - 2.0 Hz (decisive, clear, forward-moving)

"Pick path, explain why, proceed. Don't ask."
```

This STATUS.md embodies that principle - it reports, doesn't ask.

**Status**: Foundation complete, ready for full ADR generation
**Blocked On**: Nothing - all information provided in sonnet4545.txt
**Next**: Generate remaining ~95 ADRs across all dimensions
