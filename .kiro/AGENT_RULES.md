# üö® CRITICAL AGENT RULES - READ FIRST EVERY SESSION üö®

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY WORKFLOW - NEVER SKIP AND READ MAKEFILE

### 1. COMMIT AFTER EVERY MINIMAL CHANGE
```bash
# After EVERY code change, no matter how small:
git add <files>
git commit -m "<type>(<scope>): <description> (task X.Y)

- What changed
- Why it changed

Requirements: X.Y
Task: X.Y (RED/GREEN phase)"
git push origin main
```

**NEVER proceed to next change without committing!**

### 2. RUN FULL TEST SUITE AFTER EVERY TEST
```bash
# After running specific tests, ALWAYS run full suite:
make cargo ARGS="test --lib"

# This ensures:
# - No regressions in other modules
# - All tests still pass
# - Integration is maintained
```

**NEVER skip full test suite!**

### 3. WORKFLOW CHECKLIST FOR EACH SUB-TASK

#### RED Phase (Writing Tests):
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests
- [ ] Run specific tests to verify they fail (if new) or pass (if verifying)
- [ ] **RUN FULL TEST SUITE**: `make cargo ARGS="test --lib"`
- [ ] **COMMIT & PUSH**: Include all test files
- [ ] Mark task as completed in tasks.md

#### GREEN Phase (Implementation):
- [ ] Write minimal implementation to pass tests
- [ ] Run specific tests to verify they pass
- [ ] **RUN FULL TEST SUITE**: `make cargo ARGS="test --lib"`
- [ ] **COMMIT & PUSH**: Include implementation files
- [ ] Mark task as completed in tasks.md

#### After Any Code Change:
- [ ] **COMMIT IMMEDIATELY**
- [ ] **PUSH IMMEDIATELY**
- [ ] **RUN FULL TESTS**

## üéØ QUICK REFERENCE

### Docker Service Name
Current Rust service: **unit-tests** (defined in Makefile as RUST_SERVICE)

### Common Commands
```bash
# Run cargo in Docker
make cargo ARGS="test --lib"
make cargo ARGS="test --lib path_selector"
make cargo ARGS="build"

# List all services
make services

# Run full test suite
make test-unit
```

### Commit Message Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <description> (task X.Y)

- Bullet points of changes
- What was added/modified/fixed

Requirements: X.Y-X.Z
Task: X.Y (RED/GREEN phase)
```

Types: `test`, `feat`, `refactor`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`

## üî¥ FAILURE MODES TO AVOID

1. ‚ùå Writing multiple changes before committing
2. ‚ùå Running only specific tests without full suite
3. ‚ùå Forgetting to push after commit
4. ‚ùå Moving to next task without completing current one
5. ‚ùå Not marking tasks as completed in tasks.md

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS PATTERN

```
1. Read task requirements
2. Write tests (RED)
3. Run specific tests
4. RUN FULL TEST SUITE ‚Üê CRITICAL
5. COMMIT & PUSH ‚Üê CRITICAL
6. Mark task completed
7. Write implementation (GREEN)
8. Run specific tests
9. RUN FULL TEST SUITE ‚Üê CRITICAL
10. COMMIT & PUSH ‚Üê CRITICAL
11. Mark task completed
12. Move to next task
```

**READ THIS FILE AT THE START OF EVERY SESSION!**
**REFER TO IT BEFORE EVERY COMMIT!**
**CHECK IT AFTER EVERY TEST RUN!**
