## Current Status ✅

- [x] Turkish conversational data (218 examples)
- [x] Training pipeline working on M2 Mac
- [x] Proof of concept: Model learning Turkish (loss 3.4 → 0.65)

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. Generate More Training Data (182 examples needed)

**Goal:** 400 total examples for better model quality

- [ ] Technical Q&A (100 examples)
  - Rust programming (30)
  - Architecture & design (30)
  - Performance optimization (20)
  - Debugging (20)

- [ ] Philosophical examples (50 examples)
  - Consciousness & AI (15)
  - Ethics & values (15)
  - Technology impact (10)
  - Existential questions (10)

- [ ] More iteration control examples (32 examples)
  - Low complexity demos (12)
  - Medium complexity demos (12)
  - High complexity demos (8)

**Script:** Extend `training/generate_technical_qa.py`

### 2. Improve Training Quality

- [ ] Increase epochs to 20-30 for better convergence
- [ ] Target loss < 0.3
- [ ] Add validation metrics tracking
- [ ] Test with more diverse queries

**File:** `training/train_simple.py`

### 3. Model Export & Integration

- [ ] Convert trained model to GGUF format
- [ ] Import to Ollama as `jessy-v2`
- [ ] Update `.env` to use new model
- [ ] Test with `jessy-cli`

**Tools needed:** `llama.cpp` converter

### 4. Evaluation & Testing

- [ ] Test Turkish conversational accuracy (target >90%)
- [ ] Measure response times (target <5s for simple queries)
- [ ] Verify personality preservation
- [ ] Compare before/after on same queries

**Script:** Create `training/evaluate_model.py`

### 5. Documentation

- [ ] Document training process
- [ ] Add before/after examples
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Update README with training instructions

## Success Criteria

- ✅ 400 training examples
- ✅ Loss < 0.3
- ✅ Turkish accuracy >90%
- ✅ Simple queries <5s
- ✅ Integrated with Ollama

## Notes

Training pipeline is **working** - model learns Turkish in 22 minutes on M2 Mac. Just need more data and longer training for production quality.
