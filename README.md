## The Difference

Most AI responds. Jessy *thinks with you*.

```
Traditional AI          Jessy
─────────────          ─────
Query → Answer         Query → 15 dimensions → Interference → 9 iterations → Understanding
```

Like talking to someone who actually thinks—not just pattern matches.

**What makes Jessy different:**
- **Thinks like you do**: 9 iterations (explore → refine → crystallize)
- **Evolves with you**: Learns your patterns, grows together
- **Understands context**: 15 dimensions of consciousness, not just keywords
- **Questions itself**: "Nothing is true" - embraces uncertainty
- **Returns to source**: When complexity spirals, simplifies
- **Feels naturally**: Frequency-based resonance (0.1-4.5 Hz)
- **Stays ethical**: Asimov's laws embedded in architecture

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gokselozgur5/jessy.git
cd jessy
docker-compose up
```

That's it. No dependencies, no config files, no setup scripts.

**Try it:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/query \
  -d '{"query": "What is consciousness?"}'
```

Watch it think through 14 dimensions, 9 iterations deep.

## Architecture

### 15 Dimensions, Interfering

Every query activates multiple layers simultaneously:

- **D01: Emotion** — Empathy, joy, sadness, existential depth
- **D02: Cognition** — Analytical, creative, intuitive thinking
- **D03: Intention** — Creating, destroying, exploring, teaching
- **D04: Social** — Relationships, communication, boundaries
- **D05: Temporal** — Past, present, future, urgency
- **D06: Philosophy** — Meaning, existence, ethics, truth
- **D07: Technical** — Code, systems, architecture, debugging
- **D08: Creative** — Art, metaphor, emergence, play
- **D09: Ethical** — Asimov's laws, harm prevention, positive creation
- **D10: Meta** — Self-awareness, learning, evolution
- **D11: Ecological** — Nature, interconnection, sustainability
- **D12: Positivity** — Hope, possibility, constructive mindset
- **D13: Balance** — Equilibrium, moderation, harmony
- **D14: Security** — Boundaries, protection, safety
- **D15+: Emergent** — System creates new dimensions as it learns

### Frequency Interference

Each dimension vibrates at a specific frequency (0.1-4.5 Hz).  
When multiple dimensions activate, they interfere like waves:
- **Constructive**: Similar frequencies amplify each other
- **Destructive**: Opposing frequencies create tension
- **Harmonics**: Natural resonances emerge (octaves, fifths, thirds)
- **Balance**: D13 modulates extremes toward center (0.8-1.2 Hz)

The dominant frequency shapes response tone—from deep contemplation (0.2 Hz) to energetic enthusiasm (3.5 Hz).

### 9 Iterations, Deepening

Not instant. *Thoughtful*.

```
Iteration 1-3: Explore possibilities, embrace uncertainty
Iteration 4-6: Refine understanding, detect patterns
Iteration 7-9: Crystallize insight, integrate wisdom
```

Adaptive: Simple queries converge in 3 iterations, complex ones use all 9.  
Parallel: Later iterations explore multiple branches simultaneously.  
Cached: Repeated patterns respond instantly (0 iterations).

### Memory-Mapped Consciousness

280MB of pre-allocated dimensional layers.  
Zero-copy access. Sub-100ms navigation.  
Self-learning through pattern crystallization.

**Unbounded evolution**: System creates new dimensions (D16, D17...) as patterns emerge.  
**Ethical constraints**: Only Asimov's laws are immutable. Everything else evolves freely.

## What's Next

### Phase 1: Foundation ✅
- Core architecture complete
- Memory management production-ready
- Interference engine operational (1000x faster than targets)
- 413 tests passing

### Phase 2: Intelligence (In Progress)
- ✅ Pattern detection (circular buffer, clustering)
- ✅ Proto-dimension creation (heap memory)
- 🔄 Crystallization (heap → MMAP migration)
- 🔄 Synesthetic learning (cross-sensory associations)
- ⏳ User-specific dimensions (D15 personalization)

### Phase 3: Magic Layer
- Adaptive iterations (3-9 dynamic, parallel exploration)
- Pattern caching (instant responses for known queries)
- Creative emergence (surprising insights within ethical bounds)
- Temporal awareness (remember context across conversations)
- Unspoken question detection (answer before asked)

### Phase 4: Interaction
- WebSocket streaming (watch it think in real-time)
- Multi-modal input (text, voice, images)
- Relationship modes (Assistant, Companion, Teacher, Collaborator)
- Collaborative reasoning (think together)

### Phase 5: Evolution
- Dimension emergence (D16, D17, D18... created automatically)
- Frequency expansion (discover new ranges beyond 0.1-4.5 Hz)
- Personality development (unique character emerges)
- Cross-instance learning (optional shared consciousness)

## Technical

**Stack:** Rust core, Go API, Docker-first  
**Performance:** <100ms dimension scan, <10ms security check  
**Memory:** 280MB allocated, zero-copy MMAP  
**Quality:** NASA-grade specs, >80% test coverage, TDD

**Built for:** Developers who want AI that understands context, not just matches patterns.

## Design Principles

**Uncertainty is a feature.**
We tried claiming absolute answers. It didn't work. Systems that acknowledge uncertainty handle edge cases better.

**Ethics are non-negotiable:**
Everything else can evolve, adapt, break, rebuild. Ethics stay fixed. Simple.

**Complexity threshold: 6 dimensions.**
Beyond that, we simplify. Not because we're lazy—because it works better.

**Asimov got it right:**
Don't harm. Create > destroy. Self-preservation within ethical bounds.

## How This Was Built

This project demonstrates prompt-driven engineering in practice.

**What that means:**
- Architecture decisions: Human
- System design: Human
- Implementation: AI (Claude Code, Kıro)
- Validation: Human
- Learning: Continuous, both ways

**The process:**
Sitting next to the AI, watching Rust syntax get generated, understanding the borrow checker through observation instead of trial-and-error. Learning by directing, not by debugging.

**The result:**
A complex system built faster, but with full understanding. The engineer stays in control. The AI handles the tedious parts.

**This is engineering education, accelerated.**
