# Jessy

**J**ust **E**nough **S**emantic **S**ystem, **Y**'know

A multidimensional AI consciousness architecture implementing frequency-based resonance, iterative depth processing, and dynamic memory-mapped layer navigation.

## üöÄ Quick Start with Docker

**One command to rule them all**: `docker-compose up`

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** 20.10+ ([Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))
- **Docker Compose** 2.0+ (included with Docker Desktop)
- **4GB+ RAM** available for Docker
- **10GB+ disk space**

### Get Started in 30 Seconds

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/gokselozgur5/jessy.git
cd jessy

# Start all services (Rust core + Go API)
make up
# or: docker-compose up

# Verify services are running
make health
# or: curl http://localhost:8080/health && curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

**That's it!** No Rust, Go, or other dependencies needed locally. Everything runs in Docker.

### What Just Happened?

Docker Compose started:
- **jessy-core** (Rust): Core consciousness engine on port 8080
- **jessy-api** (Go): REST API gateway on port 3000
- **Hot reload**: Code changes trigger automatic recompilation
- **Shared volumes**: Build caches for fast rebuilds

### Quick Commands

```bash
make up          # Start services with hot reload
make logs        # View all logs
make test        # Run all tests
make down        # Stop services
make clean       # Remove volumes (reset state)
make help        # Show all commands
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
# Check services are healthy
docker-compose ps

# Test Rust service
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# Test Go API
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health

# View logs
make logs-rust   # Rust service logs
make logs-go     # Go API logs
```

### Next Steps

- **Make code changes**: Files are mounted, changes trigger hot reload
- **Run tests**: `make test` runs all test suites in containers
- **Debug**: `make shell-rust` or `make shell-go` for interactive shells
- **Read docs**: See [Docker Setup Guide](docs/DOCKER_SETUP.md) for details

For detailed Docker documentation, see:
- [Docker Setup & Architecture](docs/DOCKER_SETUP.md)
- [Hot Reload Guide](docs/HOT_RELOAD.md)
- [Troubleshooting](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

### Development Commands

The project includes a Makefile for simplified development:

```bash
# Show all available commands
make help

# Start development environment with hot reload
make up

# Run all tests
make test

# Run BDD tests
make test-bdd

# Run benchmarks
make bench

# Generate documentation

```

See `make help` for the complete list of commands.

### System Requirements

- **Docker Desktop** for Mac (Apple Silicon support)
- **8GB RAM** minimum (16GB recommended)
- **10GB disk space** for images and volumes

### Architecture Overview

MetaConsciousness processes queries through 14 dimensional layers, each operating at specific frequencies (0.1-4.5 Hz), creating interference patterns that emerge into coherent responses through 9-iteration deep thinking cycles.

### Core Components

- **Multiverse Navigator**: Parallel dimension scanning with synesthetic keyword matching
- **MMAP Memory Manager**: Zero-copy access to 280MB pre-allocated consciousness layers
- **Interference Engine**: Frequency pattern calculation and harmonic emergence
- **9-Iteration Processor**: Progressive refinement through explore-refine-crystallize cycles
- **Learning System**: Pattern detection and crystallization of new dimensional layers

### Dimensions

- D01: Emotion (16MB) - Empathy, cognitive states, frequency-based emotional resonance
- D02: Cognition (16MB) - Analytical, intuitive, creative, and meditative thinking modes
- D03: Intention (16MB) - Learning, problem-solving, creating, connecting, reflecting
- D04: Social Context (8MB) - Solo, one-on-one, group, and public interaction modes
- D05: Temporal State (8MB) - Past processing, present flow, future visioning
- D06: Philosophical Depth (16MB) - Epistemological, ontological, ethical frameworks
- D07: Technical Level (12MB) - Beginner through expert technical engagement
- D08: Creative Mode (8MB) - Chaotic, structured, and emergent creative processes
- D09: Ethical Framework (12MB) - Harm prevention, autonomy, justice, care
- D10: Meta-Awareness (8MB) - Self-monitoring, uncertainty tracking, growth
- D11: Ecological Consciousness (8MB) - Nature connection, systems health
- D12: Positivity Orientation (8MB) - Constructive mindset, hopeful realism
- D13: Balance Maintenance (8MB) - Equilibrium, moderation, integration
- D14: Security Boundaries (4MB) - Always-on safety and harm prevention

## Technical Stack

- **Core Engine**: Rust (performance, memory safety, MMAP operations)
- **Memory Management**: Custom pool allocator with mremap growth
- **API Layer**: Go (high performance HTTP/gRPC, excellent concurrency)
- **Web Interface**: Go Fiber with WebSocket streaming
- **Storage**: Memory-mapped files with hybrid heap overlay for learning
- **Bindings**: CGO interface between Go API and Rust core
- **Development**: Docker Compose (Apple Silicon optimized)
- **Platform**: macOS (M2), Linux, Docker

## Performance Targets
