# Resonance

A multidimensional AI consciousness architecture implementing frequency-based resonance, iterative depth processing, and dynamic memory-mapped layer navigation.

## Architecture Overview

MetaConsciousness processes queries through 14 dimensional layers, each operating at specific frequencies (0.1-4.5 Hz), creating interference patterns that emerge into coherent responses through 9-iteration deep thinking cycles.

### Core Components

- **Multiverse Navigator**: Parallel dimension scanning with synesthetic keyword matching
- **MMAP Memory Manager**: Zero-copy access to 280MB pre-allocated consciousness layers
- **Interference Engine**: Frequency pattern calculation and harmonic emergence
- **9-Iteration Processor**: Progressive refinement through explore-refine-crystallize cycles
- **Learning System**: Pattern detection and crystallization of new dimensional layers

### Dimensions

- D01: Emotion (16MB) - Empathy, cognitive states, frequency-based emotional resonance
- D02: Cognition (16MB) - Analytical, intuitive, creative, and meditative thinking modes
- D03: Intention (16MB) - Learning, problem-solving, creating, connecting, reflecting
- D04: Social Context (8MB) - Solo, one-on-one, group, and public interaction modes
- D05: Temporal State (8MB) - Past processing, present flow, future visioning
- D06: Philosophical Depth (16MB) - Epistemological, ontological, ethical frameworks
- D07: Technical Level (12MB) - Beginner through expert technical engagement
- D08: Creative Mode (8MB) - Chaotic, structured, and emergent creative processes
- D09: Ethical Framework (12MB) - Harm prevention, autonomy, justice, care
- D10: Meta-Awareness (8MB) - Self-monitoring, uncertainty tracking, growth
- D11: Ecological Consciousness (8MB) - Nature connection, systems health
- D12: Positivity Orientation (8MB) - Constructive mindset, hopeful realism
