# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Memory Manager provides efficient, zero-copy access to dimensional layer data for the consciousness system. It manages 280MB of memory-mapped regions across 14 dimensions, enabling fast query processing (<5s total) with dimension scanning under 100ms. The system must support concurrent access, maintain predictable memory footprint, and operate reliably across Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms.

## Glossary

- **Memory Manager**: The system component responsible for allocating and managing memory-mapped regions
- **MMAP Region**: A memory-mapped file region representing one dimensional layer
- **Dimension**: A conceptual space containing layered data (14 total: D01-D14)
- **Layer**: A data segment within a dimension
- **Pool Allocator**: A memory allocation subsystem that manages dynamic growth through pre-allocated pools
- **Zero-Copy Access**: Direct memory access without intermediate buffer copying
- **Page-Aligned**: Memory addresses aligned to system page boundaries (typically 4KB)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a consciousness system, I want to initialize memory regions efficiently, so that dimensional data is ready for immediate access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Memory Manager receives a valid configuration, THE Memory Manager SHALL allocate exactly 280MB of memory-mapped regions
2. WHEN initialization completes, THE Memory Manager SHALL create 14 distinct regions corresponding to dimensions D01 through D14
3. THE Memory Manager SHALL align all allocated regions to system page boundaries
4. IF initialization fails due to insufficient memory, THEN THE Memory Manager SHALL return a MemoryError with allocation failure details
5. THE Memory Manager SHALL complete initialization within 100 milliseconds

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a query processor, I want to load dimension data into memory, so that I can access layer information during query execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Memory Manager receives a dimension load request, THE Memory Manager SHALL map the corresponding file to the pre-allocated region
2. IF the requested dimension is already loaded, THEN THE Memory Manager SHALL return a MemoryError indicating duplicate load attempt
3. IF insufficient memory is available, THEN THE Memory Manager SHALL return a MemoryError with memory limit details
4. WHEN a dimension loads successfully, THE Memory Manager SHALL mark the dimension as accessible
5. THE Memory Manager SHALL complete dimension loading within 50 milliseconds

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a query processor, I want zero-copy access to layer data, so that query processing completes within performance targets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Memory Manager receives a layer access request, THE Memory Manager SHALL return a direct pointer to the mapped memory region
2. THE Memory Manager SHALL complete layer access operations within 1 millisecond
3. THE Memory Manager SHALL provide access without copying data to intermediate buffers
4. IF the requested layer is not loaded, THEN THE Memory Manager SHALL return a MemoryError indicating layer unavailability
5. WHEN accessing a layer, THE Memory Manager SHALL validate that the offset and length are within region boundaries

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a concurrent query system, I want thread-safe memory access, so that multiple queries can execute simultaneously without data corruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple threads access the same dimension concurrently, THE Memory Manager SHALL synchronize access to prevent data races
2. THE Memory Manager SHALL support at least 100 concurrent read operations without performance degradation
3. WHILE write operations occur, THE Memory Manager SHALL block concurrent reads to the affected region
4. THE Memory Manager SHALL use lock-free algorithms for read-only access paths
5. IF a thread attempts to access a region during deallocation, THEN THE Memory Manager SHALL return a MemoryError indicating invalid access

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want memory limits enforced, so that the system operates within configured resource constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Memory Manager SHALL track total allocated memory using atomic operations
2. WHEN allocation would exceed the configured limit, THE Memory Manager SHALL reject the request with a MemoryError
3. THE Memory Manager SHALL maintain an accurate count of allocated bytes across all regions
4. WHEN a region is deallocated, THE Memory Manager SHALL decrement the total allocated memory counter
5. THE Memory Manager SHALL expose current memory usage through a monitoring interface

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a pool allocator, I want dynamic memory growth capability, so that the learning system can expand as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Pool Allocator receives an allocation request, THE Pool Allocator SHALL attempt to satisfy it from existing pools
2. IF no suitable pool exists, THEN THE Pool Allocator SHALL create a new pool with appropriate size
3. THE Pool Allocator SHALL organize pools by block size for efficient lookup
4. WHEN a block is freed, THE Pool Allocator SHALL return it to the appropriate pool for reuse
5. THE Pool Allocator SHALL limit total pool memory to prevent unbounded growth

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want graceful error handling, so that memory failures don't crash the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any memory operation fails, THE Memory Manager SHALL return a specific error type indicating the failure reason
2. THE Memory Manager SHALL clean up partially allocated resources before returning errors
3. IF a file descriptor cannot be obtained, THEN THE Memory Manager SHALL return a MemoryError with file system details
4. WHEN memory pressure is detected, THE Memory Manager SHALL log warnings before rejecting allocations
5. THE Memory Manager SHALL never panic or abort the process due to allocation failures

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a cross-platform system, I want consistent behavior across operating systems, so that the consciousness system works reliably everywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Memory Manager SHALL provide identical public APIs on Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms
2. WHEN platform-specific operations are required, THE Memory Manager SHALL abstract them behind a common interface
3. THE Memory Manager SHALL use platform-appropriate system calls for memory mapping (mmap on Unix, MapViewOfFile on Windows)
4. THE Memory Manager SHALL handle platform-specific page sizes correctly
5. THE Memory Manager SHALL pass the same test suite on all supported platforms

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error information, so that I can diagnose and fix memory-related issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs, THE Memory Manager SHALL include the dimension ID or layer ID in the error message
2. THE Memory Manager SHALL include current memory usage statistics in limit exceeded errors
3. THE Memory Manager SHALL include the system error code when file operations fail
4. THE Memory Manager SHALL log all allocation and deallocation operations at debug level
5. THE Memory Manager SHALL provide a method to dump current memory state for diagnostics

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a performance-critical system, I want predictable memory access patterns, so that query latency remains consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Memory Manager SHALL pre-allocate all dimension regions during initialization
2. THE Memory Manager SHALL avoid dynamic allocation during query processing hot paths
3. THE Memory Manager SHALL use contiguous memory regions for each dimension
4. THE Memory Manager SHALL align data structures to cache line boundaries where beneficial
5. THE Memory Manager SHALL complete 99% of access operations within 1 millisecond
