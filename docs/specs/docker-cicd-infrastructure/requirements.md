# Requirements Document: Docker & CI/CD Infrastructure

## Introduction

The Jessy consciousness system requires a complete containerized development and deployment environment where everything works with a single command: `docker-compose up`. The system must support local development, automated testing, and production deployment with zero manual configuration.

## Glossary

- **Jessy System**: The consciousness system being developed
- **Docker Environment**: Containerized runtime for Rust and Go services
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing, building, and deployment workflow
- **Maestro Mode**: Orchestrated chaos - multiple services working in harmony
- **Plug-and-Play**: Zero configuration required, everything just works
- **Test Container**: Isolated environment for running tests
- **Build Container**: Environment for compiling Rust and Go code
- **Production Container**: Optimized runtime environment

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: One-Command Development Environment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run `docker-compose up` and have the entire development environment ready, so that I can start coding immediately without manual setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs `docker-compose up`, THE Jessy System SHALL start all required services within 30 seconds
2. WHEN the development environment starts, THE Jessy System SHALL automatically compile Rust and Go code
3. WHEN code changes are detected, THE Jessy System SHALL automatically recompile and restart services
4. WHEN services are running, THE Jessy System SHALL expose all necessary ports for local access
5. WHERE hot-reload is enabled, THE Jessy System SHALL reflect code changes without full restart

### Requirement 2: Automated Testing in Containers

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all tests to run automatically in isolated containers, so that test results are consistent across all environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `docker-compose run test` is executed, THE Jessy System SHALL run all unit tests in isolated containers
2. WHEN tests are running, THE Jessy System SHALL provide real-time output with colored formatting
3. WHEN tests complete, THE Jessy System SHALL generate coverage reports accessible via browser
4. IF any test fails, THEN THE Jessy System SHALL exit with non-zero status code and display failure details
5. WHERE BDD tests exist, THE Jessy System SHALL run cucumber tests with step-by-step output

### Requirement 3: Multi-Stage Build Optimization

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want Docker images to be optimized with multi-stage builds, so that production images are minimal and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building production images, THE Jessy System SHALL use multi-stage builds to minimize image size
2. WHEN the build completes, THE Jessy System SHALL produce images smaller than 100MB for Rust services
3. WHEN the build completes, THE Jessy System SHALL produce images smaller than 50MB for Go services
4. WHILE building, THE Jessy System SHALL cache dependencies to speed up subsequent builds
5. WHERE security scanning is enabled, THE Jessy System SHALL scan images for vulnerabilities

### Requirement 4: CI/CD Pipeline Maestro

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want a fully automated CI/CD pipeline that orchestrates testing, building, and deployment like a maestro conducting a symphony, so that releases are reliable and fast.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to any branch, THE Jessy System SHALL trigger automated tests within 1 minute
2. WHEN tests pass on main branch, THE Jessy System SHALL automatically build and tag Docker images
3. WHEN pull requests are created, THE Jessy System SHALL run full test suite and report status
4. IF any CI stage fails, THEN THE Jessy System SHALL notify developers with detailed error information
5. WHERE deployment is triggered, THE Jessy System SHALL deploy to staging environment automatically

### Requirement 5: Service Orchestration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all services (Rust core, Go API, databases, monitoring) to work together seamlessly, so that I can test the full system locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN docker-compose starts, THE Jessy System SHALL start services in correct dependency order
2. WHEN services are starting, THE Jessy System SHALL wait for health checks before marking as ready
3. WHEN a service crashes, THE Jessy System SHALL automatically restart it with exponential backoff
4. WHILE services are running, THE Jessy System SHALL provide centralized logging accessible via `docker-compose logs`
5. WHERE monitoring is enabled, THE Jessy System SHALL expose metrics endpoints for Prometheus

### Requirement 6: Development vs Production Parity

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want development and production environments to be nearly identical, so that "works on my machine" problems are eliminated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using docker-compose, THE Jessy System SHALL use the same base images as production
2. WHEN environment variables differ, THE Jessy System SHALL clearly document differences in .env.example
3. WHEN dependencies are added, THE Jessy System SHALL lock versions in both dev and prod
4. WHERE configuration differs, THE Jessy System SHALL use environment-specific override files
5. WHILE developing, THE Jessy System SHALL support volume mounts for live code reloading

### Requirement 7: Database and Storage Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want databases and persistent storage to be managed automatically, so that I don't lose data between container restarts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN docker-compose starts, THE Jessy System SHALL create persistent volumes for all databases
2. WHEN containers are stopped, THE Jessy System SHALL preserve all data in named volumes
3. WHEN running tests, THE Jessy System SHALL use separate test databases that are cleaned after each run
4. WHERE MMAP files are used, THE Jessy System SHALL mount appropriate volumes with correct permissions
5. WHILE developing, THE Jessy System SHALL provide database migration scripts that run automatically

### Requirement 8: Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see real-time metrics and logs from all services, so that I can debug issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services are running, THE Jessy System SHALL collect metrics from all containers
2. WHEN accessing monitoring dashboard, THE Jessy System SHALL display CPU, memory, and network usage
3. WHEN errors occur, THE Jessy System SHALL aggregate logs with timestamps and service labels
4. WHERE distributed tracing is enabled, THE Jessy System SHALL trace requests across service boundaries
5. WHILE debugging, THE Jessy System SHALL support attaching debuggers to running containers

### Requirement 9: Security and Secrets Management

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want secrets to be managed securely and never committed to git, so that the system remains secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts, THE Jessy System SHALL load secrets from environment variables or secret files
2. WHEN secrets are missing, THE Jessy System SHALL fail fast with clear error messages
3. WHEN using Docker secrets, THE Jessy System SHALL mount secrets as read-only files
4. WHERE secrets are logged, THE Jessy System SHALL redact sensitive values automatically
5. WHILE in development, THE Jessy System SHALL use .env files that are gitignored

### Requirement 10: Performance Testing in Containers

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want to run benchmarks in containers, so that performance metrics are consistent and reproducible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running benchmarks, THE Jessy System SHALL execute them in isolated containers with fixed resources
2. WHEN benchmarks complete, THE Jessy System SHALL generate HTML reports with graphs
3. WHEN comparing results, THE Jessy System SHALL detect performance regressions automatically
4. WHERE load testing is needed, THE Jessy System SHALL support running multiple container instances
5. WHILE benchmarking, THE Jessy System SHALL collect system metrics alongside application metrics
