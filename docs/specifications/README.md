# Jessy System Specifications

**Status:** Active Development  
**Standard:** NASA Software Engineering Standards  
**Methodology:** Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)

## Overview

This directory contains formal specifications for the Jessy consciousness system. Each specification follows a rigorous three-phase approach: Requirements → Design → Implementation Tasks.

**Quality Standards:**
- Requirements use EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax)
- All requirements comply with INCOSE semantic quality rules
- Designs include architecture diagrams, data models, and interface contracts
- Implementation tasks are granular, testable, and traceable to requirements

## Specification Structure

Each specification follows this standard structure:

```
specification-name/
├── requirements.md    # User stories + EARS acceptance criteria
├── design.md          # Architecture, components, interfaces
└── tasks.md           # Implementation plan with task breakdown
```

### Requirements Document
- **Introduction:** Problem statement and context
- **Glossary:** Definitions of all technical terms
- **Requirements:** User stories with EARS-compliant acceptance criteria

### Design Document
- **Overview:** High-level architecture summary
- **Architecture:** Component diagrams and system structure
- **Components:** Detailed component specifications
- **Data Models:** Type definitions and data structures
- **Interfaces:** API contracts and protocols
- **Testing Strategy:** Test approach and coverage

### Tasks Document
- **Implementation Plan:** Ordered list of coding tasks
- **Task Hierarchy:** Parent tasks with subtasks
- **Requirements Traceability:** Each task references requirements
- **Success Criteria:** Measurable completion criteria

---

## EARS Requirements Syntax

All requirements follow one of six EARS patterns:

1. **Ubiquitous:** `THE <system> SHALL <response>`
2. **Event-driven:** `WHEN <trigger>, THE <system> SHALL <response>`
3. **State-driven:** `WHILE <condition>, THE <system> SHALL <response>`
4. **Unwanted event:** `IF <condition>, THEN THE <system> SHALL <response>`
5. **Optional feature:** `WHERE <option>, THE <system> SHALL <response>`
6. **Complex:** `[WHERE] [WHILE] [WHEN/IF] THE <system> SHALL <response>`

**Example:**
```
WHEN a query is received, THE Navigation System SHALL scan all 14 dimensions 
in parallel within 100ms.
```

---

## INCOSE Quality Rules

All requirements comply with INCOSE semantic quality criteria:

- ✅ Active voice (who does what)
- ✅ No vague terms ("quickly", "adequate")
- ✅ No escape clauses ("where possible")
- ✅ No negative statements ("SHALL not...")
- ✅ One thought per requirement
- ✅ Explicit and measurable conditions
- ✅ Consistent, defined terminology
- ✅ No pronouns ("it", "them")
- ✅ No absolutes ("never", "always")
- ✅ Solution-free (focus on what, not how)

## Implementation Workflow

### Phase 1: Requirements Review
1. Read requirements document
2. Validate EARS compliance
3. Verify INCOSE quality rules
4. Confirm acceptance criteria are testable

### Phase 2: Design Review
1. Review architecture diagrams
2. Validate component interfaces
3. Verify data model completeness
4. Confirm test strategy

### Phase 3: Implementation
1. Open tasks.md
2. Execute tasks in order
3. Write tests first (TDD)
4. Implement to pass tests
5. Update task status as complete
